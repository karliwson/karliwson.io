# Me on the ☁️

## The Modern Architect blog ([karliwson.io](https://karliwson.io/))

This blog is where I share my findings, studies and POC projects about Software Architecture & Engineering, Cloud, DevOps, Blockchain and technology in general.

## Tech stack

It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for production) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

[Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) is the creator of the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter that is the basis upon which this blog is implemented.
